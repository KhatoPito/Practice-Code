Out/Ref concepts C#

The out keyword causes arguments to be passed by reference. 
This is like the ref keyword, except that ref requires that the variable be initialized before it is passed. 
To use an out parameter, both the method definition and the calling method must explicitly use the out keyword

class OutExample
{
    static void Method(out int i)
    {
        i = 44;
    }
    static void Main()
    {
        int value;
        Method(out value);
        // value is now 44
    }
}


    class RefExample
    {
        static void Method(ref int i)
        {
            // Rest the mouse pointer over i to verify that it is an int. 
            // The following statement would cause a compiler error if i 
            // were boxed as an object.
            i = i + 44;
        }

        static void Main()
        {
            int val = 1;
            Method(ref val);
            Console.WriteLine(val);

            // Output: 45
        }
    }
