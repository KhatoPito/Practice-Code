Singleton Vs Static Class note:
You can use static classes to store single-instance, global data
static constructors might be convenient, but that they are slow. Static class
are mostly used with global common data. Singleton provides faser performance
The advantage is that the code that uses the singleton doesn't need to know if it is a singleton or a transient object. Using a static class means you have to call static methods explicitly. Think about dependency injection, for example.
Moreover, singleton, as a non-static class, can still implement an interface, supports inheritance, etc. For example, you can't inherit a static class and override a virtual method in it.

A typical use of static constructors is when the class is using a log file and the constructor is used to write entries to this file.
