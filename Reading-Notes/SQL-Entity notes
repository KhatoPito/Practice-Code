1) Entity Framework VS LINQ to SQL VS ADO.NET with stored procedures?

Ans: 1) Performance  2) Speed of Development 3) Neat/Maintainable code - Entity Framework will provide

4) Flexibility - Stored procs and raw SQL are more "flexible". 
ou can leverage sprocs and SQL to generate faster queries for the odd specific case, 
and you can leverage native DB functionality easier than you can with and ORM.

You can use both in the same application, and you probably should. 
Big bulk operations should go in stored procedures or SQL (which can actually be called by the EF), 
and EF should be used for your CRUD operations and most of your middle-tier's needs.
