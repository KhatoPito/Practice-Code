Hello Mark,

My Name is Vedant Majmundar and we are connected via Professional Social forum - LinkedIn.
I was contacted few months ago for software engineering position via LinkedIn at Oracle.
I was not looking for job at that time but i mentioned that by this time of year i will be in market again.
Recently i came across that Oracle is doing lots of hiring and 
they are looking for software engineers. I am very much interested to explore new opportunities.
I have attached my resume for your review. 
Please let me know if you have any suitable position at this time.

Looking forward to hear from you soon.
