Dear Recruiter,

My Name is  XYZ and I came to know about your contact details via one of my friend who recently interviewed with Cloudera for Software Engineer position. I was contacted few months ago for software engineering position via LinkedIn at Cloudera. I was not looking for job at that time but i mentioned to the recruiter that by this time of year i will be in market again. Recently i came across that Cloudera is doing lots of hiring and  they are looking for software engineers. I am very much interested to explore new opportunities right now. Please let me know if you have any suitable position at this time.  I am attaching my latest resume for your review.

Looking forward to hear from you soon.

Best,
XYZ
